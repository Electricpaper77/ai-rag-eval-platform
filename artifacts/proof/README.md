# Proof artifacts (recruiter quick view)

- `regression_eval_example.jsonl` is a sample excerpt from a real regression evaluation run (JSONL format).
- Each line = one test case (prompt/question) with outputs + metrics fields (e.g., citations, refusal, hallucination flags, latency).
- Goal: show reproducible evaluation artifacts that support A/B + regression testing in production GenAI workflows.
